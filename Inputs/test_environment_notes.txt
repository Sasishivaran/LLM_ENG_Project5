Chatbot Test Environment Notes

For the purposes of this project, the chatbot test environment is represented conceptually.
Assume the following:
- The chatbot is accessible via a web-based interface or API.
- Test accounts can be used without impacting real customers.
- Rate limits are low but sufficient for controlled experiments.
- Logs from the test environment are similar in structure to `chat_logs_sample.csv`.

In a real deployment, access details (URLs, credentials, rate limits, and environments)
would be documented here.
