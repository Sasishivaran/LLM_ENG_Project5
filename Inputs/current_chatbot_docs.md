# Current Chatbot Documentation (Draft)

## Purpose
The customer support chatbot is intended to handle common support requests such as:
- Password resets
- Billing inquiries
- Basic troubleshooting
- Account information questions

## Current Capabilities (as documented)
- Answers FAQ-style questions using a knowledge base.
- Provides step-by-step instructions for common tasks.
- Escalates to human support when it cannot resolve an issue.

## Known Limitations
- Limited ability to complete end-to-end billing workflows.
- Inconsistent handling of multi-turn troubleshooting conversations.
- No clear routing between different model versions or capabilities.

## KPIs and SLAs (Incomplete)
- Target CSAT: 4.2 / 5 (not consistently measured).
- Target first-contact resolution rate: 70% (no recent report).
- Target average response time: < 3 seconds (no monitoring dashboard).

This documentation is incomplete and will be refined as part of the audit.
