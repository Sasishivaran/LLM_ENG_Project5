User Feedback Summary

Overall sentiment: Mixed to negative.

Key themes:
- The chatbot often fails to complete billing-related requests and escalates to human agents.
- Users report that answers about troubleshooting are generic and repetitive.
- Some users are satisfied with simple FAQ-style questions (e.g., password reset).
- Response times are sometimes slow during peak hours.

Example quotes:
- "It keeps telling me to contact support instead of fixing my billing issue."
- "The bot just repeats the same steps even after I say I already tried them."
- "For basic questions it's fine, but anything more complex and it gets stuck."
