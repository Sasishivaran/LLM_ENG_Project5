# Value Stream Map Template
Customer Support Chatbot — Current State & Future State

This template helps map the end‑to‑end workflow for the chatbot lifecycle, identify bottlenecks, and highlight automation opportunities.

---

## 1. Current‑State Workflow (As‑Is)

Document the existing process from user query → model response → escalation → resolution.

| Step # | Process Step | Description | Owner | Avg Time (mins) | Wait Time (mins) | Tools/Systems | Pain Points |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | User submits query | User enters message in chat interface | User |  |  |  |  |
| 2 | Bot receives input | Message routed to model | Engineering |  |  |  |  |
| 3 | Model generates response | LLM processes prompt and returns output | ML/AI |  |  |  |  |
| 4 | Bot sends response | Response delivered to user | Engineering |  |  |  |  |
| 5 | User follow‑up | User clarifies or repeats issue | User |  |  |  |  |
| 6 | Escalation (if needed) | Bot hands off to human agent | Support Ops |  |  |  |  |
| 7 | Human resolution | Agent resolves issue | Support Ops |  |  |  |  |

## 2. Bottlenecks & Waste

Identify delays, rework, loops, and inefficiencies.

- **Bottleneck 1:**  
- **Bottleneck 2:**  
- **Bottleneck 3:**  

Types of waste to consider:
- Waiting  
- Repetition  
- Over‑processing  
- Defects (incorrect responses)  
- Escalations due to poor automation

## 3. Metrics (Current State)

Capture baseline performance.

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Notes |
|--------|----------------|--------|--------|
| CSAT |  |  |  |
| First‑Contact Resolution |  |  |  |
| Escalation Rate |  |  |  |
| Avg Response Time |  |  |  |
| Cost per Conversation |  |  |  |
| Token Usage per Conversation |  |  |  |

## 4. Future‑State Workflow (To‑Be)

Describe the optimized process after improvements.

| Step # | Improved Step | Description | Owner | Expected Time (mins) | Automation? (Y/N) |
|--------|----------------|-------------|--------|------------------------|--------------------|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
